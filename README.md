# matrixMultiply
Code to multiply matrices
This code I wrote allows you to multiply two javascript arrays, given that they are of compatible size
simply call `matrixMultiply(matrixA, matrixB)` to use it
it will return the resulting matrix

useage example `console.log(matrixMultiply(matrixA, matrixB))`
output:`matrixC[contents]`
